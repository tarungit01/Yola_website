		    		Though the technology backing it up is powerful and complex, we made Yola easy for everyone to use.
		    	</p>
		    	<p>
		    		Our Sitebuilder doesn't ask you to download installations or plug-ins. It works on most browsers, and it's solid as a rock — secure and dependable.
		    	</p>
		    	<p>
		    		We're prepared to handle the good — like a big influx of traffic to your site. We're also ready to deal with the not-so-good — like a power outage. We monitor all Yola-hosted sites every minute of every day from multiple locations to ensure everything runs smoothly. Even with over 50 million web pages to serve, Yola sites experience 99.9% uptime.
